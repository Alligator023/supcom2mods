Wanting to get your ideas out into my mod(s)? Here's how!


Create a fork of this repository. This basically copies this entire repository and pastes it into a new repository that belongs exclusively to you!
Make your changes in your repository, then pull request those changes to my repository. I will look over your changes, and add them if I like them all. If there is something I want edited, I will comment on that pull request and talk to you about it, and once everything is good, I will merge it and your stuff is in my mod.
